### LINQ
LINQ is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework and is used to query data from specific data providers like LINQ to Objects, LINQ to Entities and LINQ to SQL.

Using LINQ for everyday tasks to query objects and whatever is loaded in memory can be very beneficial, as it may replace many trivial for-each loops and make your code easier to read, understand and maintain.

### LINQ to Objects
The LINQ to Objects provider contains a handy set of standard query operators to work with in-memory Collection<T> collections.
